# CH-DAV 40_chambers_ghg

Datafiles are different from others, b/c different heights
are measured sequentially, i.e. different heights for a
variable are stored in different rows.

This format is identified `-ICOSSEQ-PRF-` in the filetype name.

Vertical index of vars is automatically extracted from variable
INLET or LOCATION, depending on which of the two is available.
