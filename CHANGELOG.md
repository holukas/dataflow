# Changelog


## v0.0.5 | 10 Jan 2022
- Added 'if testrun' option in main for testing the script locally


## v0.0.4 | 21 Dec 2021
- ADDED: `filescanner` now outputs an additional file that lists all files for which no filetypes were defined
- ADDED: `varscanner` now outputs an additional file that lists all variables that were not greenlit (i.e.
not defined in the `configs`) and therefore also not uploaded to the db
- ADDED: new filetype `CHA10-RAW-TOA5-DAT-TBL1-1MIN-201612071258` (in external folder `configs`)
- ADDED: new filetype `FRU10-RAW-TOA5-DAT-TBL1-1MIN-201711201643` (in external folder `configs`)


## v0.0.3 | 20 Dec 2021
- ADDED: README now shows a list of currently implemented filetypes
- ADDED: new filetype `DAV12-RAW-FF6-TOA5-DAT-TBL1-1MIN-202110221616` (in external folder `configs`)
- ADDED: new filetype `DAV10-RAW-TOA5-DAT-TBL1-10S-201802281101.yaml` (in external folder `configs`)
- REMOVED: some `print` checks from code


## v0.0.2 | 19 Dec 2021
### Refactoring
- Changed: `filescanner` and `varscanner` can now be executed independently
  - `filescanner` scans the server for data files and outputs results to `dataflow` output folder 
  - `varscanner` scans the `dataflow` output folder for **all** `filescanner` results
- Changed the way required subpackages are imported: included a `try-except` clause that first tries to
import subpackages with relative imports (needed for CLI execution of the script on the server
after `pipx` installation of the script), then, if the relative imports failed, absolute imports are  
called (needed for script execution without `pipx` installation). In short, after the script was installed
using `pipx` it needed relative imports, while absolute imports were needed when the script was directly
executed e.g. from the environment.
- Removed: `html_pagebuilder` is no longer executed together with `filescanner` and `varsvanner`.  
Instead, it will be in a separate script.


## v0.0.1 | 13 Dec 2021
### Initial Release
#### General
- First implementations of DataScanner, VarScanner and FileScanner
- First implementation of html_pagebuilder
